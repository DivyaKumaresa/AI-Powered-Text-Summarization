# AI-Powered-Text-Summarization
# 📝 AI-Powered Text Summarization using Hugging Face Transformers & NLP

## 🚀 Overview
This project is an **AI-based text summarization tool** built using **Python**, the **Hugging Face Transformers** library, and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. It uses state-of-the-art **pre-trained transformer models** to extract the key information from long text and return a human-like summary instantly.

Ideal for **students**, **researchers**, **journalists**, and **content creators**, this tool simplifies understanding large documents or articles by automatically generating concise summaries.

---

## 🧠 Key Features
- 🤖 Uses **Hugging Face `pipeline()`** for easy summarization
- 🏗 Based on **transformer-based models** (e.g., BART, T5, etc.)
- 📚 Utilizes **NLTK** and **PyTorch** for preprocessing and performance
- 🧪 Works on **any plain text input** (articles, blog posts, essays, etc.)
- ⏱ Quick to set up — lightweight and efficient
- 🖥 Fully implemented in Python

---

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used
- `transformers` (Hugging Face)
- `torch` (PyTorch)
- `nltk`
- `re` (for cleaning input)
- `Python 3.7+`

---

## 🧪 How It Works 
🔹 Step 1: Load Pretrained Model 

from transformers import pipeline summarizer = pipeline("summarization") 

🔹 Step 2: Provide Input Text 


input_text = """ The objective of this project is to create an AI-based text summarization tool that can extract the most important information from a given document using NLP and Hugging Face transformer models. """


🔹 Step 3: Generate Summary 

summary = summarizer(input_text, max_length=60, min_length=25, do_sample=False) print(summary[0]['summary_text'])
## 🖼 Sample Output 
🔸 Input: 
The Transformers library from Hugging Face provides thousands of pretrained models to perform tasks on texts such as classification, information extraction, question answering, summarization, translation, and more. It is very user-friendly and allows for easy integration into Python applications. 

🔸 Output Summary: 
Hugging Face's Transformers library offers thousands of pretrained models for text classification, extraction, summarization, and more in Python.
